## Introduction

This work focuses on improving the efficiency of learning likely-admissible heuristics by incorporating uncertainty using Bayesian Neural Networks. The proposed method is evaluated across various domains including the 15-puzzle, 24-puzzle, 24-pancake, and 15-blocksworld.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:
